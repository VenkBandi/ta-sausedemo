## Introduction

Test automation is the process of using software tools and frameworks to automate test execution, compare actual outcomes to expected outcomes, and generate test reports. This helps to increase efficiency, accuracy, and repeatability of testing processes, as well as reducing the time and costs associated with manual testing. <br><br>In here we are going to test SWAG Labs (Sauce Demo - https://www.saucedemo.com). We are going to use robot framework with Selenium for the automation.
## Scope

The project covers the following areas of the Sause Demo website:

- Login page for all accepted users and error scenarios.
- Product page, including sorting features and product detailed view.
- Your cart page for all accepted users.

## Features

- Utilizes robot framework to write tests in a human-readable format.
- Uses Selenium for interacting with web elements and performing automated actions.
- Includes a wide range of test cases covering login, product features, cart functionality, and more.
- Provides easy-to-understand bug reports and test outcomes.


## Tools and Technologies Used

This test automation project for Swag Labs utilizes a variety of tools and technologies to streamline the testing process and ensure efficient and accurate results.

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for writing the test automation code.

- **Robot framework**: A Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tool that allows writing test scenarios in a human-readable format.

- **Selenium**: A popular open-source framework for automating web browser interactions and testing.

- **DataDriver**: The DataDriver implementation for utlising Excel and CSV files for test automation.


These technologies are combined to create an effective testing framework that automates test cases, performs comparisons between expected and actual outcomes, and generates detailed test reports.
